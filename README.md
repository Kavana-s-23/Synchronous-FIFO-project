A synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) is a type of data buffer used in digital systems that operates under a single clock domain, meaning both read and write operations occur using the same clock signal.
This project provides a synthesizable Verilog implementation of a Synchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out) memory buffer, along with a comprehensive testbench for verification.

// Code: Verilog
